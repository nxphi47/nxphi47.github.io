<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency parsing problems (syntactic and discourse
    parsing) into a series of conditional splitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability
    distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports efficient top-down decoding, which is
    linear in number of nodes. The conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference
    facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured inference. Crucially, for discourse
    analysis we show that in our formulation, discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing
    which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring  segmentation as a pre-requisite. Experiments
    show that our model achieves good results on the standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without
    pre-trained representations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more computationally expensive
    than ours. In discourse parsing, our method outperforms SoTA by a good margin. Our source code will be publicly
    available.
