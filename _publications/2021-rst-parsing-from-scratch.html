<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    We introduce a novel top-down end-to-end formulation of document level discourse parsing in the Rhetorical Structure
    Theory (RST) framework. In this formulation, we consider discourse parsing as a sequence of splitting decisions at
    token boundaries and use a seq2seq network to model the splitting decisions. Our framework facilitates discourse
    parsing from scratch without requiring discourse segmentation as a prerequisite; rather, it yields segmentation as
    part of the parsing process. Our unified parsing model adopts a beam search to decode the best tree structure by
    searching through a space of high scoring trees. With extensive experiments on the standard RST discourse treebank,
    we demonstrate that our parser outperforms existing methods by a good margin in both end-to-end parsing and parsing
    with gold segmentation. More importantly, it does so without using any handcrafted features, making it faster and
    easily adaptable to new languages and domains.
